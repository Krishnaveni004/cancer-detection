## Academic Major Project

###### (Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology)

### Problem Statement

Lung and breast cancers are some of the most dreadful diseases in developing countries and its mortality rate is 19.4%. The chance of survival at the advanced stage is less when compared to the treatment and lifestyle to survive cancer therapy when diagnosed at an early stage of cancer. Manual analysis and diagnosis systems can be greatly improved with the implementation of image processing techniques.

A number of researches on image processing techniques to detect early-stage cancer detection are available in the literature. But the hit ratio of early-stage detection of cancer is not greatly improved. We propose a novel approach in our project.

### Methodology
With the advancement in machine learning and deep learning techniques, the early diagnosis of cancer is attempted by a lot of researchers. With the remarkable success of deep learning in visual object recognition and detection and many other domains, there is much interest in developing deep learning tools to assist radiologists and improve the accuracy of screening mammography. Recent studies have shown that a deep learning-based CAD system performed as well as radiologists in standalone mode and improved the radiologistsâ€™ performance in support mode.

The neural networks are thus expected to play a key role in the recognition of cancer cells among the normal tissues, which in turn provides an effective tool for building an assistive AI-based cancer detection tool. In this project, we try to build a Deep Learning Model to detect cancer using medical images.

### Objective of the Project
There is some already existing software that is designed to detect lung or breast cancer but they are not accessible to the normal patient or else they are not free of cost. Because they are available offline hence it consumes more space to store all the dataset hence it increases space complexity and makes that application heavy.

The main objective of this project is to build a dynamic, responsive and user-friendly web application, based on a saved instance of a Deep Learning Model, which predicts the probability of a patient to be diagnosed as positive for cancer or breast cancer. We aim to build various Deep Learning models that could be trained on different kinds of medical images and accordingly predict the probability of the new input. Based on the user input, different saved models will be used in the background for predicting the output.

### Scope of the Project
We aim to build a web interface that would deal with different types of images and accordingly predict the probability of being diagnosed with either breast cancer or lung cancer. The models are expected to handle a wider range of medical input formats like a mammogram or a CT scan. The web interface is created to make it easy to understand and use for non-technical general users also who are unaware of the CLI commands.

At this stage, we are aware of many requirements of the project that are yet to be fulfilled. We shall make sure that the project is kept alive with regular updates and modifications, which change and improve the functional Deep Learning models.

One limitation of our project is its failure to automate the process of identifying which kind of image is being passed and automatically decide which model to use. Currently, the user is expected to provide such details manually. One of the additional features that we could integrate into later stages is the heat map localization of the input medical images which clearly demarcates the regions affected.

These limitations, along with the general need to make the user interface more appealing and attractive than it already is, shall be implemented in future versions, along with any other potential areas for change that shall present themselves in the days to come.
